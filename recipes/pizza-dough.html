        <h3>Roberta's delicious and easy to make pizza dough</h3>
        <p>This recipe, adapted from Roberta's,
            the pizza and hipster haute-cuisine utopia in Bushwick,
            Brooklyn, provides a delicate, extraordinarily flavorful 
            dough that will last in the refrigerator for up to a week. 
            It rewards close attention to weight rather than volume in the matter of the ingredients, 
            and asks for a mixture of finely ground Italian pizza flour</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup plus 1 tablespoon 00 flour</li>
            <li>1 cup plus 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine sea slat</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.</li>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams 
                (a little less than 1 cup) lukewarm tap water, the 
                yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour 
                mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, 
                approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest 
                for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal 
                pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily 
                floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest 
                and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 
                24 hours in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the 
                dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to
                shape it for pizza.)</li>
            <li>To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily 
                floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it, 
                then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. 
                Top and bake.</li>
        </ol>
