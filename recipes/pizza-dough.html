        <h3>Roberta's delicious and easy to make pizza dough</h3>
        <p>This recipe, adapted from Roberta's,
            the pizza and hipster haute-cuisine utopia in Bushwick,
            Brooklyn, provides a delicate, extraordinarily flavorful 
            dough that will last in the refrigerator for up to a week. 
            It rewards close attention to weight rather than volume in the matter of the ingredients, 
            and asks for a mixture of finely ground Italian pizza flour</p>
